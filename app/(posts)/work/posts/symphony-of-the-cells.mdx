# Symphony of the Cells

The constant demand for faster, more efficient apps in the market presents developers with a unique blend of challenges and opportunities. Recently, I had the privilege to work on a project that perfectly encapsulates this scenario.

## The Challenge

Our client came to us with an existing React Native app being deployed on both iOS and Android platforms. Though the app was functional, there was room for substantial improvement. The client sought a solution that would revamp the app, making it quicker, easier to manage, and ideally, native to the operating systems concerned.

## The Solution

The nail-biting journey began with our team deciding to go with SwiftUI for building the iOS app. The edge of SwiftUI is that it is native to iOS, which means it interacts more fluently with iOS system making it faster, thereby providing the user with a more seamless experience. The decision to stick with React Native for the Android version was based on our existing proficiency with the language. At that moment, venturing into unknown territory like Kotlin or Java didn't seem prudent.

Initially, there was optimism that the existing codebase of the previous React Native Android App could be used. However, upon evaluation, we discovered this was not feasible. We then took the audacious step to build the Android app from square one.

In terms of tools, we used Expo for building the React Native app and Xcode for SwiftUI. Revenue Cat was the preferred choice for handling in-app subscriptions, enhancing the user experience.

## The Result

The redesigned apps proved to demonstrate excellent performance and maintainability. The SwiftUI application, being native to iOS, exceeded our expectations by a mile. On the other hand, the Android app, while not native, also showed improved performance.

The client’s reception to the final product was overwhelmingly positive. The revamped apps weren’t just a kick in operational speed; they also simplified the maintenance process. From a developer’s perspective, the addition of this resurgent app to our portfolio has been quite rewarding.

In conclusion, no challenge is too big, or no timeline too short when you have a dedicated team working on leveraging the best technologies to curate the best solutions. This project was a testament to the prowess of SwiftUI and React Native in app development and a reminder for us to always keep exploring, learning, and growing!
